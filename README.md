This repository is for a Shiny app that houses the database and metadata for all SDG Global Action Plan indicators. Key features of this app include:

1. Data and estimates are compiled for 57 SDG indicators from the UNSD SDG Database and for 8 non-SDG indicators from WHO's Global Health Observatory (both sources were last accessed in July 2019)
2. Metadata is extracted from the official UNSD SDG metadata website https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/ and the WHO GPW 13 metadata document available at bit.ly/gpw13-metadata 
3. Data and estimates are included for all 194 Member States of WHO, where available, over the time period 2000-2018
4. The database can be filtered by WHO region, Member States, range of years, and selection of indicators
5. Filtered data can be downloaded as a CSV file

This database will be updated periodically to track changes in the UNSD and WHO databases.
